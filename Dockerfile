# .node binding is missing from node_modules and every SQLite call throws
# "Could not locate the bindings file" at runtime.

# step — it `gh release download`s `database.db.gz` and gunzips to that path.
# We then COPY it into the image at /app/data/cnmv.db (CNMV_DB_PATH). The
# explicit `data/<name>.db` reference is required for the workflow's grep
# `COPY\s+\K(data/\S+\.db)` to match.
